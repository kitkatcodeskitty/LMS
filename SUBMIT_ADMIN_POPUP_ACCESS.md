# Sub-Admin Popup Management Access

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to enable sub-admin users to access the popup management feature in the admin dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Route Updates (`LMS/server/routes/popupRoute.js`)
- **Before**: Routes were protected with `isAdmin` middleware (full admin only)
- **After**: Routes now use `isAdminOrSubAdmin` middleware (admin and sub-admin access)

**Updated Routes:**
- `POST /api/popups` - Create popup
- `GET /api/popups` - Get all popups  
- `PUT /api/popups/:id` - Update popup
- `DELETE /api/popups/:id` - Delete popup
- `PATCH /api/popups/:id/toggle` - Toggle popup status

### 2. Frontend Sidebar Updates (`LMS/client/src/components/admin/Sidebar.jsx`)
- **Before**: Popup Management was only in `fullAdminMenuItems`
- **After**: Popup Management added to `subAdminMenuItems`

**Menu Items for Sub-Admins:**
- Student Enrolled
- Pending Orders  
- KYC Review
- Withdrawals
- **Popup Management** (NEW)

### 3. Middleware Verification
The `isAdminOrSubAdmin` middleware in `LMS/server/middleware/auth.js` was already properly configured to allow both admin and sub-admin access:

```javascript
export const isAdminOrSubAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.isAdmin || req.user.isSubAdmin || req.user.role === 'admin' || req.user.role === 'subadmin') {
    next();
  } else {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      success: false,
      message: "Access denied. Admin or Sub-Admin privileges required." 
    });
  }
};
```

## Access Control Summary

### Full Admins (isEducator = true)
- ✅ All admin features including popup management
- ✅ Can create, edit, delete, and toggle popups
- ✅ Full access to all admin dashboard features

### Sub-Admins (isSubAdmin = true OR role = 'subadmin')
- ✅ Popup management (NEW)
- ✅ Student management
- ✅ Order management  
- ✅ KYC review
- ✅ Withdrawal management
- ❌ Package creation (restricted to full admins)

### Regular Users
- ❌ No access to admin features
- ✅ Can view active popups on home page

## Testing
1. Login as a sub-admin user
2. Navigate to `/educator` (admin dashboard)
3. Verify "Popup Management" appears in the sidebar
4. Test creating, editing, and deleting popups
5. Verify all popup management functionality works correctly

## Security Considerations
- Sub-admins can only manage popups, not create packages
- All popup operations require proper authentication
- Role-based access control is maintained throughout the application
- No escalation of privileges beyond intended scope
